      <h3>What is mental wellbeing and why is it so important?</h3>
      <p class="intro">
        Mental wellbeing can be defined in many ways. We may use it to express
        how we feel, how we're coping with daily life or what seems possible in
        the moment. Our mental well-being is so important because it is a key
        contributor to our overall health. It helps us be more emotionally and
        mentally resilient and allows us to flourish in various aspects of our
        lives, even through challenging times.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are 5 main steps which you can take to improve your mental
        wellbeing and as a result, make the most out of life.

          Physical activity can have many benefits for your mental health.
          <br />By setting goals and acheiving them, your mood can be positively
          affected because of the brain's <em>chemical changes</em> in response.
          <br />Physical activity can also promote <em> better sleep</em> as it
          makes you more tired towards the end of the day. <br />Participating
          in physical activity can even help us <em>manage stress</em> as it
          releases cortisol, an important hormone in the stress response.
          <br />
